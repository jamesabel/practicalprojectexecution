Ownership and Responsibilities
==============================

One Owner
---------
**For every work item, be it an issue, bug, feature, deliverable, etc., there will be exactly one owner.**

In some circles this is known as "one throat to choke".  The owner is not necessarily the one to do the work.
In fact, most of the time they are not doing all of the work alone.  The work item may also be passed to someone
else more appropriate, but at any time there is exactly one owner (if a work item is passed, the receiving
person must acknowledge that they are now the owner).

Not having an owner is expected in the proposal stage (e.g. when ideas or "stories" are being created), but as soon
as something becomes a deliverable is has exactly one owner.

A common mistake is where communications (e.g. emails) are addressed to more than one person but the sender expects
the work to be done.  Worse yet, they assume the more people they address it to, the greater the chance that someone
will "pick it up".  For example, when an email is addressed to multiple people (Dear Joe and Jane, Please deliver
ABC to XYZ ...) the sender may assume it will be done, but Joe thinks Jane will do it and Jane thinks Joe will.
Multiple addressees is discouraged, since the sender may incorrectly assume that the work will be completed without
actually assigning an owner.  If a communication (e.g. email) is meant to be a directive to accomplish a task
(e.g. from a manager to an employee) it should be addressed to a specific person and the owner should explicitly
acknowledge that they are the owner.  Of course, others may be "cc'd" and this is entirely appropriate to suggest
others that may end up helping.

It is appropriate to ask a group for someone to volunteer to be the owner, but it's not a work item until someone
explicitly agrees to be the owner.  When an owner is assigned this should be communicated to the group.

In the end, each work item is owned by exactly one person.

Responsibilities
----------------
**Each person should have the smallest number of responsibilities possible, preferably one.**

Responsibilities need to be described at the highest level possible.  This gives an employee a larger, more impactful,
and clear area that they own and concentrate on (see above on "One Owner").  Employees will be less fragmented and
distracted.  Reducing the number of responsibility items also makes *managing* people and projects less complex.

Often people incorrectly try to amass the largest number of deliverables possible so that it looks like they
are contributing more (and more than their peers).  However, this increases organizational overhead since it
increase the number of items to be tracked.  Organizations must resist the temptation to measure output merely in
terms of number of "things" someone is doing; rather measure their *impact* to the organization.
