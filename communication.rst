Communication
=============

Scrum tools (e.g. Jira) is used to communicate project priorities and status.  Since all team members have access,
status can be observed without 'polling' team members.

Slack is used for channel oriented communication.

github is used for software bugs and features found during development.  This works together with continuous
integration.  In general, avoid leaving 'todo's in check-in code; instead, enter a Jira ticket or github issue.
'todo's are more for very short term flagging of items to be fixed prior to next check-in.

wikis are encouraged around specific technologies or tools (github hosts wikis).

Semantic Versioning (semver) is used for version numbers.

email is acceptable for more general communication that doesn't fall into the above categories.

In general text messages are discouraged except for true emergencies.
