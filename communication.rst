Communication
=============

`Scrum <https://www.scrum.org/>`_ tools (e.g. `Jira <https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira>`_) is used to
communicate project priorities and status.  Since all team members have access, status can be observed without
'polling' team members.

`Slack <https://slack.com/>`_ is used for channel oriented communication.

`github <https://github.com/>`_ is used for software bugs and features found during development.  This works
together with continuous integration.  In general, avoid leaving 'todo's in check-in code; instead, enter a
Jira ticket or github issue. 'todo's are more for very short term flagging of items to be fixed prior to next
check-in.

wikis are encouraged around specific technologies or tools (github hosts wikis).

`Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org/>`_ (AKA semver) is used for version numbers.

email is acceptable for more general communication that doesn't fall into the above categories.

In general text messages are discouraged except for true emergencies.
