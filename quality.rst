Quality is holistic.  Is includes:

- Testing (see the `testing <testing.html>`_ section)
- Determine the Real Root Cause
- Assumed Responsibility

Determine the Real Root Cause
-----------------------------
The first answer of why a problem happened often merely reveals another symptom rather than the true underlying cause.
When an issue is found, it is often important to ask the
`Five Whys <https://hbr.org/2010/04/the-five-whys-for-startups>`_.
Originating decades ago at `Toyota <http://www.toyota-global.com/company/toyota_traditions/quality/mar_apr_2006.html>`_, this
technique is valuable to find what actions need to be taken to actually solve a problem.  Like a persistent child,
the team should ask 'why' a problem happened five times in order for the true actions needed present themselves.


Assumed Responsibility
----------------------
When an issue is found the person or team that found the issue assumes the responsibility for the issue. This
can be either fixing the issue themselves or finding someone else that takes ownership of fixing the issue.
